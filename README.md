# Kdrama-watchlist-project

K-Views is a project I create for a user to register/log in to keep a watchlist of the Kdrama shows they are currently watching and to document ones they have completed. Once a user is logged in their dashboard will show their current watchlist of shows they have started. They have the options to add to their watch list, edit, delete, and view their completed shows. There is also a 'Reviews' to show all reviews of all users.
